// Q:03 What is throttling?

// if we have to execute a function after a certain amount of time, based on the event 
// but it countineusly call the function when we start the event so we use the throttling
// like we are scrolling the page and we have to call the function after the 100ms 
// and it increasing the count till scrolling is stop 

// technique used in programming to control how often a particular function 
// can be executed over a specified period of time.
// It ensures that the function is not called too frequently,
// but instead is called only after a certain amount of time has passed.
// The function is executed at regular intervals,



// // Q:04 What is debouncing?

// unlike throttling the debounce technique will ensure that a function is not called until a 
// certain amount of time has passed without it being called.
// but it calls the function once after the event is stop

// Q:05 What is callback?

// Q:06 What is promise?
// it is a JS object that handles async operations.
// it has three states pending, resolve, reject. 

// Q:07 What is async await?
// async means that a function will return a promise.
// await means that we should wait for the promise to resolve before continuing the code execution.

// Q:08 What is Execution Context?
// Q:09 What is callback hell?
// Q:10 What is SQL and NoSQL?
// SQL is a structured query language that is used to manage the relational database system.
// NoSQL is a non-relational database system that is used to manage the unstructured data.

// Q:12 var vs let vs const?
// Q:13 What is hoisting?
// Q:14 What is arrow function?
// Q:15 What are the states of the promises?
// Q:16 What is the pass by value and pass by reference?
// when deal with primitive data types like string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol say it is pass by value   
// when deal with non-primitive data types like object, array, function say it is pass by reference

// when we clone the array or object and change the value of the cloned object or array it will change the value of the original object or array
