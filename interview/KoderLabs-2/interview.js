// Q:22 How we target the DOM element of the react (useRef())
// Q:23 Can we change the state using useRef(), it reflect or update?
// if we get the value using useRef() and that variable is rendered on screen, and call the setter of the useState() than what will happen

// Q:25 If I create my own hook like useState and set the values in that hook, so will it work like the useState
